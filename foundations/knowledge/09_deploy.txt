Guide: Deploying a Web Application on Hugging Face using Docker

1. Prepare the Project
- Ensure the project has the following files:
  - app.py (Flask/Gradio application entry point)
  - index.html (frontend page)
  - style.css (styling file)
  - requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
  - Dockerfile (Docker build instructions)
  - models/ (optional, if the model file is required)

2. Write a requirements.txt
Example:
Flask
torch
torchvision
Pillow
psutil
gunicorn

3. Create a Dockerfile
Example:
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:7860", "app:app"]

4. Push to Hugging Face Spaces
- Create a new Space on Hugging Face and select Docker as the SDK.
- Clone the Space repository locally.
- Copy all project files into the Space directory.
- Push the code using Git commands:
  git add .
  git commit -m "Deploy web app with Docker"
  git push

5. Deployment
- Hugging Face will automatically build the Docker container.
- After building, the application will be accessible at the Space public URL.

6. Update the Project
- To make changes (such as editing app.py, index.html, style.css, or Dockerfile):
  git add .
  git commit -m "Update"
  git push
- Hugging Face will rebuild the container automatically.

Notes:
- Free Spaces have limited resources (RAM/CPU). Optimize models for smaller size.
- For large models, consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage).
